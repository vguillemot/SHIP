\title{SHrinkage covariance Incorporating Prior knowledge}
\description{
The SHIP-package implements the shrinkage estimator of a covariance matrix
given any covariance target, such as described by Schaefer and Strimmer in
2005.  In addition, it proposes several targets based on biological
knowledge extracted from the public database KEGG.
}
\details{
To use the shrinkage estimator, one should just have at hand a data set in
the form of a \eqn{n \times p}{n x p} matrix, and a covariance target.

If one wishes to use the proposed targets, the data set should be compatible
with KEGG, i.e. it should be possible to extract for each gene the pathways
it belongs to.  This information, for example, can be found in libraries
such as hgu133plus2.db.

\examples{

# A short example on a toy dataset
# require(SHIP)

data(expl)
attach(expl)

sig1 <- shrink.estim(x,targetD(x))
sig2 <- shrink.estim(x,targetF(x))
sig3 <- shrink.estim(x,targetCor(x,genegroups))
sig4 <- shrink.estim(x,targetG(x,genegroups))

paste(sig1[[2]],collapse=" ")
paste(sig2[[2]],collapse=" ")
paste(sig3[[2]],collapse=" ")
paste(sig4[[2]],collapse=" ")

# Example on how to get the gene groups lists
require(hgu95av2.db)
# e.g. we have some interesting gene names :
vec <- c("MYC","ID2","PTGER4","ATF4","FGFR1","MET","HLA-DRB6")
# we then want to convert them into Probe Sets
symb <- as.list(hgu95av2SYMBOL)
pbsets <- names(symb[unlist(sapply(vec,function(x,l) which(l==x)[1],symb))])
# Probe Sets which are themselves converted into a gene groups list
genegroups <- as.list(hgu95av2PATH)[pbsets]
}
